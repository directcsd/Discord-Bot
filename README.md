# Discord-Bot

What started as a simple experiment to create a Discord Bot, became the project to create a Bot that could answer using the char-rnn proposed by akarpathy

Here I use the code form minesh.mathew of the char-rnn in Keras

The bot is trained in a corpus extracted from a WhatsApp group so to simulate conversations from this same group of people.
